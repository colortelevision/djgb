if you're reading this, we have both leveled up our GIT skills. round of applause for the team.


open the following link and scroll down. click on the link that says MAC OS X ARM BUILD, and that will download the latest gb-studio (4.2.x) 

https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/actions/runs/13504340919

once downloaded, i think you should be able to just open it up, and open the .gbsproj file from this folder. it wont work with older versions of gb-studio

command+4 will open the music section and you can peruse the current catalogue of Gameboy music. 



UNRELATED NOTE, 

i think I've set up git from your computer before, but if not we'll do that whenever you get a chance to remote desktop me in.

we'll be able to keep an ongoing folder with notes, ideas, instructions, COMMANDS, files, etc that we can both update and sync between us. 

it's super powerful especially once we're building a website from scratch, 

for example i can make a webpage from a template file for a tutorial guide, and just show you where to paste stuff, the command to update and BOOM its added to that website
